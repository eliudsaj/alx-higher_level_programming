#data structure - way of storing data
 built-in : list , dictionary, ttupple
 user-defined: stack,queue, tree, graph

list - address of every element is called index
     - helps access first and last(indexing)
	eg: sample_list = [5,0.,'hello']
dictionary - key value pairs
	- accessed as needed
	- key accesed as a value
	eg. dict_items = {'first': 'Apple', 'Second' : 'ball'}
tuple - similar to list but is immutable
	-cannot be changed during execition
	eg. sample_tuple = (1,2,3)
set - every set must be unique
	first_set = {1,2,3,}

user defined

stack - basis of LIFO
	-accesed only at the top position
	-pushing and pooping operation
Queue - basis of FIFO
	has head and tail
	-operations both front and the back
trees - has nodes
	-every node preceeds parent node
	-last node is called 
graph - verticle edges called nodes
      - finite number of nodes and edges. eg facebook
Linked lists - each element is connected to eachother via pointer
		python dont have a linked list in a standard library
		implementation has to be done manualy
